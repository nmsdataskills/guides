# Resources
The first place you should look for anything R-related is the
[Awesome R](https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R) collection.
For similar lists, see [Awesome Awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness).

## If You're Entirely New To R
There's already a lot of information online for newcomers, so we aren't really covering this ourselves.
Here are some links to get you started:

- Learn R interactively with Code School's [Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/).
- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is a lot like Code School,
but for statistical programming.
They have some great introductory classes available at no cost,
as well as additional classes for paying users.
They're pretty fun, and they have a lot of interactive exercises.
- Finally, read this article about [learning R](http://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/)
over at R-bloggers.
R-bloggers is a great community that's been around for quite a while.
You can learn a lot by searching through the archives.

For those with previous programming experience,
there's also the Learn X in Y Minutes project,
which has [an entry on R](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/r/).

## Getting Set Up
You can learn about installing R at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) - the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This presentation was made using
[RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-desktop/)
and RMarkdown.

If you're interested in RMarkdown, note that the Pandoc implementation of markdown is used, [as documented here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html).

RStudio makes [great reference cards](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
for their products. You might be interested in:

## Learning R
If you already have some experience with R or another programming language,
you can check out the latest version of Hadley Wickham's book,
[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), for free online!
While some topics in the text are more technical than others,
it's a great guide for anyone looking for answers to
"How does R work?" instead of "How do I use R?"

Also, if you have a question about `X`, try typing `?X` in the R console when using RStudio!
RStudio will bring up the relevant help page from the R documentation.
If that doesn't turn anything up, try `??X` instead to search for `X` in the documentation.

CRAN provides a [reference card](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf)
for the R language.
