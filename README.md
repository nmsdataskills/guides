## North Mississippi Data Skills
We provide accessible training in professional, open-source data workflows and best practices to researchers from various backgrounds.

Our workshops are designed for students with research projects in mind.
We assume that your program of study involves some statistical preparation relevant to your research.
From experience, we also assume that your instructor had to cover a lot of theoretical details
and only had so much time to cover professional tools.
That's where we hope to be of assistance!

If you're interested in learning more or attending a workshop,
join us on Slack at [nmsdataskills.slack.com](http://nmsdataskills.slack.com).
Currently, anyone with an msstate.edu email address can join the Slack team.

## Thanks!
We'd like to thank the MSU Mitchell Memorial Library and the MSU Instructional Media Center
for providing us with this meeting space.

In addition, many thanks are owed to those attendees who have patiently attended the early workshops,
reviewed materials, and provided valuable feedback. Your support is very much appreciated!
